# Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand — K-Means Clustering

A focused clustering analysis of Facebook Live Sellers in Thailand.  
This project uses K-Means to find groups of posts by status type and engagement. The goal is to reveal patterns in content types (video, photo, status, link) and how users interact with them.

## What is included
- `Clustering_Analysis_K_Means_.ipynb` — main Jupyter notebook with data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, evaluation and visualizations.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies needed to run the notebook.
- `data/facebook_live_sellers_thailand.csv` — (place the dataset here) the raw dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/` — (optional) extra notebooks or experiments.
- `results/` — (optional) exported figures and model output.

## Key findings (short)
- Status types cluster into distinct groups by engagement metrics.
- Videos generally show higher median engagement than other types.
- Clusters help identify post types and engagement patterns that can guide content strategy.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or later recommended
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- A working virtual environment is recommended
